<title>Scope</title>

<para>"JHotDraw 8" is an object oriented framework for developing drawing editors in the Java programming
language.</para>

<para>It consists of two independent frameworks, 
  and a number of demos ("samples"), which demonstrate typical uses of the framework.</para>

<para>Frameworks:</para>
<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>the "Drawing Editor Framework"</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>the "Application Framework"</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Samples:</para>
<itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para>the "Mini" samples</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>the "Grapher" sample</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>the "Teddy" sample</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The "Drawing Editor Framework" can be used to realize drawing
editors for computer aided design and for artistic drawings. 
Drawings can be animated and interactive. It is possible to back a drawing with
a data model, allowing a structured drawing editor to be used as a user interface
for the data model.</para>

<para>The "Application Framework" can be used to create 
applications which comply to platform-specific user interface guidelines. 
Such as such as <xref linkend="bib.ahig"/> and <xref linkend="bib.whig"/>.</para>

<para>The "Mini" samples demonstrate small use cases from both frameworks.</para>

<para>The "Grapher" sample demonstrate a working drawing editor application. It focuses on many use cases
of the application framework and the drawing framework.</para>

<para>The "Teddy" sample demonstrates a working text editor. It focuses on the application framework only.</para>
